   Dependencies: sc3-plugins

   velocity: Speed of advance in infile, relative to outfile (Range: >= 0) This is the inverse of a timestretch (i.e., 1/n\: higher values make the output shorter, lower values – less than 1 – make it longer). This permits an infinite timestretch.

   density: Amount of grain overlap (Range: > 0) Values < 1 leaves intergrain silence, i.e., gaps. Extremely small values will cease to perform predictably.

   grainsize: Size of the grains in milliseconds (must be larger than bsplice + esplice)

   pitchshift: Transposition of grains in + or - (fractions of) semitones

   grainAmp: Amplitude of individual grains

   bsplice: Begin splice,  length of start-splices on grains in seconds

   esplice: End splice,  length of end-splices on grains in seconds

   pan:  Set stereo position in outfile (-1, 1)

   scatter: Randomisation of grain position; Range 0 to 1 (Default: 0.5)
